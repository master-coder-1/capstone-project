## 1. Problem Statement
This project develops and compares machine learning models to predict corporate credit ratings using financial ratios. The analysis employs different classifiers (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting ) and identifies the most influential financial indicators for credit rating prediction. Through hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis, we provide insights into the key factors that determine a company's credit rating.

### Background
Credit ratings play a crucial role in financial markets by providing an independent assessment of a company's creditworthiness. These ratings significantly influence:
- Borrowing costs for companies
- Investment decisions by institutional investors
- Regulatory compliance and capital requirements
- Market perception and stock valuation

### Goals
The main objectives of this project are to identify
1. Which machine learning model best predicts corporate credit ratings using financial ratios?
2. What are the most important financial indicators that influence credit ratings?

### Expected Benefits
- More efficient credit risk assessment
- Data-driven insights for financial decision-making
- Objective and consistent rating predictions
- Early warning system for potential rating changes

### Findings
The **Random Forest classifier** emerged as the superior model with test accuracy of 78.28% and achieved a strong performance across different risk categories. For more details please refer [Key Findings](#key-findings) section under [Conclusions](#7-conclusions)

## 2. Model Outcomes and Predictions

### Learning Type
- **Type**: Classification (Multi-class)
- **Approach**: Supervised Learning

### Model Output
The model predicts credit risk categories:
1. Lowest Risk (AAA)
2. Low Risk (AA+, AA, AA-, A+, A, A-)
3. Medium Risk (BBB+, BBB, BBB-)
4. High Risk (BB+, BB, BB-, B+, B, B-)
5. Highest Risk (CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC+, CC, C)
6. Default (D)

## 4. Data Preprocessing/Preparation

### Data Quality Assessment
Initial analysis shows:
- Complete dataset with no missing values
- Uneven distribution across risk categories
- Presence of outliers in financial ratios
- Strong correlations between some features

1. **Missing Data Analysis**
   - Dataset contains 7,805 corporate credit ratings with no missing values

2. **Data Distribution Analysis**
   - Most financial ratios show non-normal distributions with significant skewness
   - Plot below Shows the distribution of financial ratios across the dataset
     ![Data Distribution Analysis](./images/data_distribution_analysis.png)

3. **Credit Rating Distribution**
    - The dataset exhibits an uneven distribution across risk categories. However, this may not indicate a data quality issue, as such patterns are common within this domain. Typically, only a small number of companies hold the highest credit ratings or fall into default, while the majority are concentrated in the low and medium-risk category.
         
         | Risk Category                              | Count |
         |--------------------------------------------|-------|
         | Low Risk (A+, A, A-, AA+, AA, AA-)         | 2548  |
         | Medium Risk  (BBB+, BBB, BBB-)             | 2461  |
         | High Risk (BB+, BB, BB-, B+, B, B-)        | 2445  |
         | Highest Risk (CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC, CC+, C) | 256   |
         | Lowest Risk  (AAA)                         | 90    |
         | Default  (D)                               | 5     |

    - This can be seen in the box plot shown below
        ![data_distribution_analysis_boxplot.png](images/data_distribution_analysis_boxplot.png)
    - Computed outlier percentages using the IQR method and identified features with the highest proportion of outliers. The bar chart below shows the percentage of outliers detected per numerical feature (IQR rule â€” values outside [Q1 - 1.5*IQR, Q3 + 1.5*IQR]).
      ![Outlier Percentages](./images/outlier_percentages.png)

    - Features with >10% outliers:

      | Feature                         | % outliers |
      |---------------------------------|------------|
      | Return On Tangible Equity       | 15.08%     |
      | Debt/Equity Ratio               | 12.68%     |
      | ROE - Return On Equity          | 12.57%     |
      | Free Cash Flow Per Share        | 12.24%     |
      | Operating Cash Flow Per Share   | 11.48%     |

    - Also examined whether outliers cluster in rows. There are **4,079** rows with at least one outlier. The distribution of the number of outlier features per row is shown below.
      ![Outliers per Row](./images/outliers_per_row_distribution.png)

    These results suggest outliers are common in several financial ratios so we must consider RobustScaling during preprocessing.

5. **Correlation Analysis**
    - There is strong positive correlation between various features
      ![Correlation Matrix](images/correlation_heatmap.png)

    - Highly Correlated Features (likely redundant)

      | Feature 1               | Feature 2              | Correlation |
      |-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
      | Operating Margin        | EBIT Margin            | 0.9997      |

      | EBIT Margin             | Net Profit Margin      | 0.879104    |
      | EBITDA Margin           | Pre-Tax Profit Margin  | 0.81917     |
      | Pre-Tax Profit Margin   | ROA - Return On Assets | 0.797267    |
      | Net Profit Margin       | ROA - Return On Assets | 0.787621    |
      | EBITDA Margin           | Net Profit Margin      | 0.767419    |
      | Operating Margin        | ROA - Return On Assets | 0.754847    |
      | EBIT Margin             | ROA - Return On Assets | 0.754676    |
      
### Data Cleaning
1. **Missing Values**
   - No missing values found in the dataset
   - Complete data verification performed using pandas isnull() method

2. **Outlier Handling**
   - Used IQR method to detect outliers
   - Applied RobustScaler to handle outliers in financial ratios.

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Removed non-predictive metadata columns:
     - Rating Agency, Corporation, Rating Date
     - CIK, Binary Rating, SIC Code
     - Sector, Ticker
   - Retained all 16 financial ratio features

### Data Encoding
1. **Target Variable Encoding**
   - Grouped original ratings into 6 risk categories for more robust classification (Reference - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-credit-rating.asp)

     | Risk Category | Rating                      |
     |---------------|-----------------------------|
     | Lowest Risk   | AAA                         | 
     | Low Risk      | AA+, AA, AA-, A+, A, A-     |
     | Medium Risk   | BBB+, BBB, BBB-             |
     | High Risk     | BB+, BB, BB-, B+, B, B-     |
     | Highest Risk  | CCC+, CCC, CCC-, CC+, CC, C |
     | Default       | D                           |

     ![Grouped Ratings Distribution](images/grouped_rating_distribution.png)
   
   - Used LabelEncoder for numerical representation
   
2. **Feature Scaling**
   - Applied RobustScaler to all numerical features which helps in handling outliers and non-normal distributions

### Data Split
- Training Set: 80% (6,244 samples)
- Test Set: 20% (1,561 samples)
- Used stratified splitting to maintain class distribution
- Random state set to 42 for reproducibility

## 5. Modeling

   - Hyperparameters tuned: n_neighbors [3, 5, 7, 10]

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Linear model with probabilistic output
   - Hyperparameters tuned: C [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 15]

3. **Decision Tree**
   - Interpretable, handles non-linear relationships
   - Hyperparameters tuned: max_depth [5, 10, 15, None]

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Handles high-dimensional data well
   - Hyperparameters tuned: C [0.1, 1, 10, 15], kernel ['rbf']

## 6. Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics
1. **Primary Metrics**
   - Accuracy: Overall correct predictions
   - Classification Report: Helps in identifying Precision, Recall, F1-score per class
   - Confusion Matrix: Detailed error analysis

2. **Secondary Considerations**
   - Training Time: Model efficiency
   - Model Complexity: Interpretability vs. performance
   - Robustness: Performance across risk categories

3. **In Credit Risk prediction models**,
   - For High Risk classes (High Risk, Highest Risk, Default) : High recall is usually more critical as missing a default can be extremely costly. Few false positives can be tolerable.
   - For Low Risk classes (Lowest Risk, Low Risk): High precision is more important as incorrectly labeling a safe company as risky would result in lost opportunity for investors and restrict access to capital for companies.
   - For Medium Risk classes (Medium Risk) : Balancing of precision and recall is desirable.

## 7. Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Model Performance**

    The **Random Forest classifier** emerged as the superior model with the following characteristics:
    
    - **Highest test accuracy:** 78.28%  
    - **Excellent balance** between complexity and interpretability  
    - **Strong performance** across different risk categories  
    - **Robust handling** of non-linear relationships in financial data  
    
    ##### Rationale for Model Selection
    The Random Forest was chosen as the best model for several compelling reasons:
    
    ##### 1. Superior Performance
    - Outperformed other models including Neural Networks, SVM, and Logistic Regression
    - Demonstrated consistent performance across different risk categories
    - Achieved better generalization with 78.28% test accuracy vs 77.9% for the next best model
    
    ##### 2. Practical Advantages
    - Faster training time (4 seconds) compared to Gradient Boosting (108 seconds)
    - Less prone to overfitting due to ensemble nature
    - Provides built-in feature importance analysis
    
    ##### 3. Business Relevance
    - Offers interpretable results crucial for financial decision-making
    - Handles non-linear relationships common in financial data

2. **Feature Importance**
   - Long-term Debt / Capital ratio emerged as the most influential predictor
   - Pre-Tax Profit Margin showed strong predictive power
   - Liquidity measures (Current Ratio) also significantly impact credit ratings

3. **Practical Implications**
   - Companies should focus on maintaining strong profitability metrics
   - Managing leverage and maintaining adequate liquidity are crucial
   - Multiple financial ratios should be considered holistically

### Limitations

1. **Data Constraints**
   - Dataset limited to historical data from 2010-2016
   - No macroeconomic variables included
   - Industry-specific factors not fully captured

2. **Methodological Limitations**
   - Models may not capture complex interactions between features
   - Temporal aspects of credit ratings not considered
   - Class imbalance in certain rating categories

### Future Work

1. **Model Enhancement**
   - Implement more advanced ensemble methods (XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Explore deep learning approaches for complex pattern recognition
   - Develop industry-specific models

2. **Feature Engineering**
